This is the high-detail Corvette with (WolfPack quality) textures.

Mesh by Maciek Skawinski.

Textures by Don Showalter, and poly-reduced for all us folks with 
average machines to 52,000 polygons.

Conversion from LightWave by George Mezori.


Look for more conversions from our talented friends in the LightWave
arena from "ZOO".  What's a model without good textures??  A grey mess.
